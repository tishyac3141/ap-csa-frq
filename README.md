# AP-Exam-Practice-2020
a collection of Java free-response-questions to prepare for the AP CSA Exam
navigate to the branch 'questions' to view the questions and try to solve them 
navigate to the branch 'solutions' for the complete answer to the question
the 'Main' class in both the 'solutions' and 'questions' branch has some test code for you to test your solution 
(please use the Main class, it was tedious work)

please note that some of the questions are taken from while I was preparing for the AP CSA exam
and AP Classroom provided additional practice, as well as old frq's from previous year's exams
