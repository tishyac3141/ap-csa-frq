     * A positive integer is called a “self-divisor” if every decimal digit of the number is a divisor 
     * of the number, that is, the number is evenly divisible by each and every one of its digits. 
     * For example, the number 128 is a self-divisor because it is evenly divisible by 1, 2, and 8. 
     * However, 26 is not a self-divisor because it is not evenly divisible by the digit 6. Note that 0 is
     * not considered to be a divisor of any number, so any number containing a 0 digit is NOT a self-divisor. 
     * There are infinitely many self-divisors.
